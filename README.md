# Why Redux

![gif](http://g.recordit.co/53HPpuHZ5p.gif)

The code you clone down will have the functionality working as seen above.  

_Note that all components are written in the same file index.js. While this is not conventional, it will make our jobs a little easier as we begin to refactor to redux._

## Your task

Take a look at the current component structure. `App` renders a div with two children, `Header` and `Counter`.  Your goal is to make the changes described below _without altering the structure of which components render what._

* Remove the line that prints out `The current count is less than <some number>` from the `Counter` component.
* Print that description (feel free to use the same code) in the `Header` component where in place of where it currently says "Welcome to React"
